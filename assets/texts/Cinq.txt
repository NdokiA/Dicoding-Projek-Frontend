Cinq Association is an associate that specializes in single combat and dueling. Suppose you'd like to settle some disputes with an honorable duel with some hefty prices you might request Cinq Fixers as a stand in for you.

Information I heard from the Seven Fixers IDs, Cinq Fixers seems also to be in charge of holding joint conferences and events. Also, I found from Virgillius that Cinq Fixers really do abide by their code of honours. They would really let bygones be bygones as long as both parties agree to end their disputes via duel.

I've met Cinq Associate Fixers from the West Section during the La Manchaland Supression and several South Section fixers from the Sinners IDs.

Their combat revolves around consistenly taking the initiatives while striking enemies critical points using their rapier.
