Association that specialize in killing and assasination requests, though not the only one that does the job. However, do note that requesting associate fixer gonna cost you a fortune.

These types of requests apparently is quite common in The City, with the Shi fixers trying to accomplish them silently given a limited time frames. Thus, many of their Fixers grew tired from being overworked.

I stumbled with a Shi Associate Fixer back then on K-Corp's Nest. However, it happened so fast I don't even realize they're there.

Anyway, some Sinners IDs shown that they primarily fight with long katanas, being heavily wounded due too their work load, yet maintaining their efficiency on killing the enemies.
