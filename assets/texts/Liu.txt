Liu Association specializes in direct combat and warfare that involves a large groups of people. Each individual member of Liu is equipped to deal numbers of parties. 

Yet, they also value cooperation and coordination over individual action.

From my observation on Sinners IDs, Liu Associate Fixer fight with martial arts, armed with flame-inducing gauntlet. Well, since flame spreads, it will be a nice strategy to deal with numerous enemies.

Though, everytime I asked why do they use fire, they kept answer with "maintaining the harmony" or "going with the flow" or something like that. Such a roundabout remark.
