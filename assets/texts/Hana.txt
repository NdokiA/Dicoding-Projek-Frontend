I heard this information from Don Quixote. This association sit on the highest hierarchy of Fixer's management. They're the head of the twelve Associations and composed of high grade Fixers.

Hana Association is in charge of ranking Offices and Fixers, issueing Fixer licenses, assigning Colors, grading hazard levels, etc. 

However, Faust added that they can only grade them up to Star of The City level. As the Impuritas Civitatis level is served for threats that vioalte the ethics of the City, and can only be assigned by The Head.

We managed to meet Hana Associate Fixer once during La Manchaland's Supression.
