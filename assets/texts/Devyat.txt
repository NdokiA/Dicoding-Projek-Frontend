They primiarly focus on delivering items to, "any place in the world". Usually they're tasked with delivery of high-value object through the harsh terrain since the costs involved.

Devyat' Association pay decently, but considering the dangerous nature of courier work and the soft time limits by the Assocation, Fixers take their offer as a last-resort job.

Observing Sinners with Devyat' Assosciate ID's, they carry an Asssciation-issued delivery trunks known as "Courier Trunk"  to store their packages, but also function as their weapon. Courier Trunks also carries a low-level AIs named Poludnitsa.

During combat, when the imposed delivery time limits draw near, the Courier Trunk began strengthening its user, yet also harming them, eventually killing themselves. Thus, it's best to not take them on long battle, or best, having them retreated and being replaced while also exploting the Trunk's buff.
